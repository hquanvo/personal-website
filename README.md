Todo list:
# General
    - Add "Project" Section
    - Add "Footer"
    - Make the website mobile compatible (with resizing screens and such)

# Navigation Bar
    - Style anchors to make it more visible that they're clickable

# About me
    - Add a photo
    - Write a description about myself
    - Probably resize the section so that it takes up the screen
    - On smaller screen size, the section should be shown the following from top to bottom: About me, photo, description

# Skills
    - Touch up on the CSS used here
    - Also resize the section so that it takes up the screen
    - On smaller screen size, rearrange the 3 sections so that it's shown consecutively one after another instead of arranging all three size by size

# Project
    - Create a 3x3 grid
    - Link some projects github into the some of the grid slot. If live demo is possible, link the demo as well
    - Unusued slots can have a coming soon message
