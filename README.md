# Personal Portfolio Website

Portfolio website built using React.js and styled using Tailwind. Repo will be regularly updated as I make more projects.

To run the site locally:

1. On root, run `npm install` on the terminal

2. Then run `npm run dev`

Website is deployed [here](https://hquanvo.github.io/personal-website/).
